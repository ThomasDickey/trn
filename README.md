# `trn` for Modern Linux

This is `trn` for Linux. It's based on `trn-4.0-test77-patched.tar.gz`
from Sourceforge, plus all the patches from Debian.  I've put it together
to save the world the trouble, and so that I can have `trn` on
non-Debian systems.

The `trn-4.0-test77` branch has the original code, before any patches
were applied, should anyone want to see it.
